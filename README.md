Training on github
About me...
I'm veteran freelance professional for financial information systems.
I've done everything in my local stores and never used a kind of profesional version control system.
I'm doing knowledge refresh on modern web and internet based development.
So I'm here... with my first git branch and commit! So let God help us!
